GO-CLI
by Samuel Mulatua Jeremy

Here is my attempt for the GO-CLI assignment for Software Engineering Academy from Fasilkom UI X GO-JEK

Notes for this version :
- For the shortest path algorithm, I've tried to find some resources, but due to the time limitations, finally I used the
    distance formula ( sqrt (x1-x2)^2 - sqrt (y1-y2)^ 2)

Usage Directions:
- Type A,B,C for the Maps menu, Order GO-RIDE, and Order History
- Type D to exit
- Afterwards, you can follow the instructions mentioned on screen

The code is named gocli.rb
